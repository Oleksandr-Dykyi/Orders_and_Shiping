## Orders_and_Shiping

#### Technology Stack:
Tableau (calculated fields, function, dashboard creation)

#### Project Description:
In this Tableau project, I harnessed the power of data visualization to gain insights into order processing and shipping.I started by creating a new workbook using data sourced from a CSV file found in Tableau Data Examples.

Within the workbook, I designed three essential sheets:

Average Delivery Days by Shipping Type: This sheet visualizes the average number of days it takes for orders to be delivered, categorized by different delivery modes (Ship mode). The delivery duration was calculated using the Order Date and Ship Date fields.

Orders by Delivery Time: This sheet breaks down the number of orders based on the time it takes for delivery, providing insights into delivery speed and efficiency.

State-wise Delivery Durations: To gain geographical insights, I created a map visualization showcasing the average delivery time for orders in each U.S. state. A gradient was used to represent variations in delivery times.

These sheets were integrated into a single interactive dashboard, enhanced with filters for Order Date, Segment, and Delivery Type. This user-friendly dashboard allows for dynamic data exploration and analysis.
